# CudaNeuralNetwork
This is a C++ CUDA powered neural network editor, 
Current Features:
  Run a dummy neural network to analize speed and memory usage statistics.
Planned Features:
  Networks:
    Networks will be created, trained or destroyed.
    Networks will be connected together as layers.
    Input and output Layers will be connected networks.
    Networks will be saved to and loaded from files.
  Editor Interface:
    The minimalist visual interface will allow you to entirely visuallize your neural networks.
    Weights, biases, and values of each node will be shown visually.
    Networks can be edited visually.
    Inpot and output layers can be modified, and connected/disconnected to networks.
